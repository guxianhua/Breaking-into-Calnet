For this, I realized that the bufsize is 6560.

It starts at 0xbfffddc0.

I also find out that the sfp is at 0xbffff768.

This leaves me with 6572 bytes to write in until i get to the jmp address.

The jmp address needs to be overwritten with "0x08048c1c" since it is 3 more than "0x08048619".

Therfore my strategy is to pass in 6572 "NOP", "\x1c\x86\x04\x08", and then the shell.
